# Chakra Settlement Primitives

## Introduction

**Settlement Primitive** is a crucial method that enables the conversion of BTC (or other assets) into Settlement Artifacts, as well as the reverse process where these artifacts are converted back into their original assets. The characteristics of each Settlement Primitive—such as security measures, operational protocols, and financial scale—significantly influence the value and utility of the corresponding Settlement Artifacts.

**Supported Settlement Primitives**:

1. **Cobo Settlement Primitive**: Utilizes the Cobo Custody Wallet to manage BTC, converting it into Settlement Artifacts on the Chakra Network.
2. **Babylon + Cobo Settlement Primitive**: Integrates with the Babylon Network for staking and settlement, converting staked BTC into artifacts.
3. **Babylon + Cubist Settlement Primitive**: Combines Babylon's staking capabilities with Cubist's security protocols to generate and manage artifacts.
4. and MORE!

These artifacts are fully interchangeable, allowing for flexible and secure management across different platforms. Please see [here](../../guides/btc-collateral-transformation.md) for the example workflow of Cobo Settlement Primitive.&#x20;

## Expanding Settlement Primitives

The **Settlement Primitive** concept is designed to be open and flexible, allowing other companies and protocols to participate and contribute their primitives. This openness fosters innovation and expands the possibilities for asset management and conversion.

We provide a framework and guidelines for participation to encourage the integration of new settlement primitives. Below are examples of the specifications that protocols or companies may adhere to to qualify as Settlement Primates providers.

**Example Specification Table for Settlement Primitives:**

We invite companies and protocols interested in becoming a Settlement Primitive to review the specifications and submit their proposals. By contributing to the open Settlement Primitive ecosystem, participants can enhance the financial infrastructure and expand the utility of Settlement Artifacts across the Chakra Network.
