#### Parameter Description

| Parameter     | Type    | Description                                                                |
| ------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| txid          | uint256 | The unique transaction identifier of the cross-chain message.              |
| from\_chain   | string  | The identifier of the source chain from which the message originates.      |
| from\_address | uint256 | The sender's address on the source chain.                                  |
| from\_handler | uint256 | The handler or contract address on the source chain that sent the message. |
| payload       | bytes   | The data payload of the cross-chain message.                               |
| sign\_type    | uint8   | The type of signature used to verify the authenticity of the message.      |
| signatures    | bytes   | The cryptographic signatures used to authenticate the message.             |

The `receive_cross_chain_msg` function is likely part of a smart contract that is designed to handle messages coming from different blockchain networks. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of each parameter:

* **`txid`:** An unsigned 256-bit integer representing the unique transaction identifier of the cross-chain message. This helps in tracking and verifying the message across different chains.
* **`from_chain`:** A string that identifies the blockchain network from which the message originates. For example, this could be "Ethereum" or "Binance Smart Chain".
* **`from_address`:** An unsigned 256-bit integer representing the sender's address on the source chain. This could be a standard address format encoded as a number.
* **`from_handler`:** An unsigned 256-bit integer representing the handler or contract address on the source chain that sent the message. This is useful when the message is sent through a specific contract rather than directly from an address.
* **`payload`:** The actual data payload of the message, which could contain any kind of information, such as instructions for the receiving contract or token transfer details.
* **`sign_type`:** An unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the type of cryptographic signature used to verify the authenticity of the message. Different types of signatures (e.g., ECDSA, Schnorr) may require different verification methods.
* **`signatures`:** A byte array containing one or more cryptographic signatures that prove the message was sent by the claimed sender. These signatures are verified using the specified `sign_type`.
